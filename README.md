## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This exercise extends the previous work on Java Generics.  
Modify the previous generic method so that it can accept a **variable number of arguments** instead of only three.

- Implement a method that uses **varargs** to handle an indefinite list of arguments.
- The method should iterate over the provided arguments and print each one to the console.
- The method must be generic and flexible enough to work with different types and different numbers of arguments.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java 17 (or higher)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / Visual Studio Code (any Java IDE)
- JDK (Java Development Kit)

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Java JDK version 17 or higher installed.
- A Java IDE installed (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.).
- Basic understanding of Java Generics and varargs (`...` syntax).

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Make sure your project SDK is set to Java 17 or later.
4. Compile all the necessary Java classes (`Persona.java`, `GenericMethods.java`, `Main.java`, and optionally `Printable.java`).

---

## ▶️ Execution

1. Run the `Main` class.
2. You will see:
    - Different numbers of arguments being passed and printed.
    - Different types of objects printed without issues.
    - A demonstration of how varargs handle indefinite parameters cleanly.

Example:Persona: Anna Smith, Age: 25 Persona: John Doe, Age: 30 Hello World 42 3.14

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is designed for local execution and educational purposes.  
If desired, you can:

- Package the project into a `.jar` file using Maven or directly via your IDE.
- Deploy the `.jar` to any server or container that supports Java execution (`java -jar yourproject.jar`).
